Hi, I'm Katia! Nice to see you here! I have over 4 years of experience as a Data Analyst and 2 years as a Business Analyst. Bringing value through data is what motivates me, as well as working in a collaborative work environment. Let's build something great! Curiosity about myself: Currently living in Toronto, Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦, but I also lived in Japan ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ.
